# 02562 Rendering Course Submissions

This repository contains my submissions for the course **02562 Rendering** at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The course focuses on using WebGPU to render realistic images through ray tracing and other advanced rendering techniques.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each corresponding to different weeks and parts of the course:

- `w1/`: Worksheet 1 assignments
- and so on..

- `textures/`: Directory containing texture files used in the projects

- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML pages

## Technologies Used

- **WebGPU**: A modern graphics API for rendering and computation on the web.
- **Ray Tracing**: A technique for generating realistic images by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane.
- **WGSL**: WebGPU Shading Language, used for writing shaders.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the HTML files in a browser that supports webGPU for example Google Chrome
