          A BSP works by recursively subdividing a space into convex sets using
          hyperplanes, which helps in organizing objects within that space.
          Here's a simple breakdown of how a BSP tree works: 1. Choose a
          partitioning plane. 2. Divide the objects into two groups based on
          their position relative to the plane. 3. Recursively apply this
          process to each group, creating a binary tree structure. Each node in
          the tree represents a partitioning plane, with the left child
          representing one side of the plane and the right child representing
          the other. This structure is usefule for visibility determination and
          collision detection, as it allows for faster searching in the scene.
